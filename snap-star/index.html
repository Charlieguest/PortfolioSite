                        The game demo is the end product of my Group Games Development module. In this module 26 of us were tasked developing a game demo.
                        My role began as a senior programmer and switched to project lead mid-way through production. I Wrote the majority of logic for the
                        different mechanics and strucures within the game using C++ and blueprint in Unreal Engine.

                    Below is a playthrough video of our game. It is an open world platformer and collectothon where the player makes their way around the world taking photos
                    of creatures and saving them to a journal. 
                </p>
                <p class="card-content__text-column">
                    Each of the creatures however, isn't quite ready to have their photo taken yet. The player needs to find out what they need in order to become "photo ready".

                <p class="card-content__text-column">
                    I Started this project in the role of a senior programmer, building out mechanics requested by my technical leader. I commicated back and forth, iterating on
                    each mechanic so that it was to our team's liking. I have a few examples of this below:

                <p class="card-content__text-column">
                    I was tasked with creating a grappling hook that would be for grappling the player across gaps but also for grabbing collectable berries and pulling them
                    towards you.

                    We needed a way to check if you had the right item to set each animal to a 'photograph ready' state. I was tasked in solving this problem. I decided
                    to create an inventory system to that would allow you to pick up game items and when you interacted with the animal it would filter through an inventory
                    list if you have that item required for you to photograph it.
                </p>

                <p class="card-content__text-column">
                    As the project developed, the design team decided it would be best to simplify the way in animals were going to be set as 'photograph ready'. There was
                    only going to be one item that was required to be equipt rendering the inventory useless. We had also had feedback saying that the were too
                    many different buttons performing each player action.
                </p>

                <p class="card-content__text-column">
                    I took the current inventory system and repurposed it to become a loadout system instead. This let the player switch between their tools efficiently, using
                    the same keybinds to interact with each tool.
