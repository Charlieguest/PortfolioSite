						Hello my name is Charlie Guest. I'm a Second year university student who is looking forward to start a career in the games industry. Although this will be first time i've worked in the industry. I've also spent time as a junior web developer through an apprentisceship. My hobbies include hiking, 5 a-side football and reading. I love designing and bringing to life creations for others to experience. Which has lead me to the games industry.
